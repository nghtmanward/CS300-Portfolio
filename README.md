# CS300 Portfolio – Shawn Ward

This repository contains my final portfolio artifacts for CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms. It includes my Project One analysis 
and my completed Project Two advising assistance program, along with a reflection on what I learned throughout the course.

## Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis

**File:** `CS 300 Project One.docx`

Project One focused on analyzing the runtime and memory efficiency of three data structures:

- Vectors  
- Hash Tables  
- Binary Search Trees  

I evaluated each structure based on Big-O performance for insertion, search, and traversal operations. This analysis guided 
my decision for which structure to use in Project Two.

## Project Two: Advising Assistance Program

**File:** `ProjectTwo.cpp`

Project Two required implementing a C++ command-line program that helps academic advisors view course information. The program:

- Loads course data from a CSV file  
- Stores the data in a chosen data structure  
- Prints all courses in alphanumeric order  
- Allows users to look up a specific course and view its prerequisites  
- Includes a menu-driven interface  
- Follows industry-standard best practices for readability and maintainability  

I used the data structure recommended in my Project One analysis to ensure efficient lookup and sorting.

## How the Program Works

1. **Load Data:**  
   The user enters the CSV filename, and the program loads each course into the data structure.

2. **Print Course List:**  
   Courses are sorted alphanumerically and displayed with their course numbers and titles.

3. **Print Course Information:**  
   The user enters a course number to view its title and prerequisites.

4. **Exit:**  
   The program ends cleanly when the user selects option 9.

## Reflection (Module Eight)

Throughout this course, I strengthened my ability to design and implement programs using appropriate data structures. 
Project One helped me deeply understand how vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees differ in terms of runtime 
and memory usage. This analysis directly influenced my design decisions in Project Two, where selecting the right data 
structure made the program more efficient and easier to maintain.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that the program handled user input gracefully and produced clear, 
readable output. I overcame this by breaking the program into smaller functions, adding meaningful comments, and testing 
each part thoroughly. This approach improved both the reliability and maintainability of my code.

This course also reinforced the importance of writing adaptable software. By structuring my program around modular functions 
and clean data handling, I created a solution that could be expanded in the future—for example, adding new menu options or 
supporting additional course fields.

Overall, CS 300 strengthened my problem‑solving skills, deepened my understanding of data structures, and improved my ability 
to write clean, professional, and efficient code.
